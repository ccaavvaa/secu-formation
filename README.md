Minimal Express + SQLite starter built with TypeScript. Run `npm run dev` for live reload, then use `GET /messages`, `GET /messages/:id`, and `POST /messages` to interact with the embedded database. These routes intentionally concatenate SQL to showcase injection vulnerabilities—ideal for security demos. See [Repository Guidelines](AGENTS.md) for workflows.
